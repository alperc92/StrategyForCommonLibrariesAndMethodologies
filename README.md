# Strategy For Common Libraries And Methodologies
As part of my daily role as being team lead developer and software solutions and design architect, I will publish my ideas on how to achieve common libraries and methodologies within a software team.

This document will, especially, be related to the tech stack that I am involved in, in which it currently relies heavily on:
- .Net Core/5
- Microsoft Azure
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Microservices oriented design
- MVC design
